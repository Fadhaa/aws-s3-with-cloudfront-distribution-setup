# üöÄ Setup CloudFront with HTTPS for S3 Static Website (Updated 26 July 2025).

This guide explains how to deliver your S3-hosted static website securely using **CloudFront with HTTPS**.
Let's supposed that you created bucket name **statsolve-s3** and the Domain name is **mystatsolve.click**.

---

## üß≠ Why Use CloudFront?

- Adds **HTTPS support** (S3 static sites support only HTTP natively)
- Improves **performance** with global CDN caching
- Adds **security** options (signed URLs, WAF, rate limiting)
- Can connect to a **custom domain** (like `www.statsolve.com`)

## ü™ú Step-by-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Your S3 Bucket
Make sure:
- **Static website hosting is enabled**
- Your files (e.g., `index.html`) are **publicly readable**
- You can access the **S3 Website Endpoint** (e.g., `http://YOUR-Bucket-NAME.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)
- In my example the **YOUR-Bucket-NAME** is **statsolve.click**
- For setting S3 bucket, follow this guidance (https://github.com/Fadhaa/aws-s3-with-cloudfront-distribution-setup/blob/main/docs/s3-setup-guide.md)

####  You also need to create TLS certificate
1. Go to **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**
2. Click **Request**
3. Under **Certificate type**, select **Request a public certificate** and then click **Next**

5. Leave all other settings as default and click **Request**
6. Go to **Certificates** and click on the certificate that has your domain name.
7. In the **Domains**, click **Create records in Route 53** and then click **Create records** to add CNAME of your certificate in your Route 53.
8. Wait untill the validation completing and proceed to setup your cloudfront distribution

## üîê Security Notes

- CloudFront with **S3 website endpoint** cannot use Origin Access Control (OAC). If you want private buckets, you must use the **S3 REST endpoint** with OAC.
- Attach **AWS WAF** for DDoS protection or IP filtering (see next guide).
